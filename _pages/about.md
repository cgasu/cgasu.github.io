I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Jeff Zhang](https://search.asu.edu/profile/4553810). My research focuses on efficient machine learning systems, with an emphasis on recommender systems, memory-aware model optimization, and sequential recommendation. I am interested in scalable learning systems that balance modeling effectiveness with system and hardware constraints.

Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Microsoft (2021--2022). I received my M.S.E. from the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) and my B.Eng. from [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/).
